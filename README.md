# Doordash Delivery Time Prediction Model
This repository contains code and analysis for a Delivery Time Prediction Model using the DoorDash dataset from Stratascratch. The model utilizes Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree algorithms to predict delivery times.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Stratascratch website and contains historical data on food delivery orders. It includes features such as restaurant locations, customer details, order timestamps, and actual delivery times.

## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were used for data analysis and model building:

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: Numerical computing
Matplotlib: Data visualization
Seaborn: Enhanced data visualization
datetime: Handling date and time data
sklearn: Machine learning toolkit
